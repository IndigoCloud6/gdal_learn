# C++ GDAL Learning Repository

Welcome to the **C++ GDAL Learning Repository**! This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning how to use the **Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)** with **C++**. Whether you're new to GDAL or looking to deepen your understanding, this repository provides resources, examples, and code snippets to help you get started.

## Features

- **Basic Examples**: Step-by-step guides to understand how to use GDAL in C++.
- **Data Processing**: Learn how to read, write, and manipulate geospatial data.
- **Coordinate Transformations**: Examples of reprojecting data and handling coordinate systems.
- **Raster and Vector Data**: Demonstrations on handling raster and vector formats supported by GDAL.
- **Error Handling**: Tips and best practices for managing errors in GDAL.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- **C++ Development Environment**: Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) and build system (e.g., CMake).
- **GDAL Installed**: You can install GDAL via package managers like `vcpkg` or build it from source. Make sure the GDAL libraries and headers are accessible to your project.
- **Basic Knowledge of C++**: Familiarity with C++ syntax and concepts is recommended.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IndigoCloud6/gdal_learn.git
   cd gdal_learn
   ```

2. **Set Up GDAL**:
   - Use `vcpkg` to install GDAL:
     ```bash
     vcpkg install gdal
     ```
   - Or configure your environment to link to an existing GDAL installation.

3. **Build the Examples**:
   - Using CMake:
     ```bash
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

4. **Run the Examples**:
   Execute the generated binaries to see GDAL in action.
